1. DIFFERENT BETWEEN DOCUMENT AND WINDOW OBJECTS

       In JavaScript, the document object and the window object are both fundamental
       objects in the browser environment. Although they are closely related and often used together, 
       there are some key differences between them. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

    Scope:
           The window object represents the global scope in a browser environment. 
          It is the top-level object that contains all other objects, including the document object. 
          On the other hand, the document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser and provides access to the content within that document.

    Properties and Methods:
           The window object provides properties and methods that are not specific to the document content. 
           It includes properties like location, navigator, console, and methods like setTimeout(), setInterval(), etc.
           These properties and methods are not directly related to the HTML document itself but provide additional functionality and access to the browser environment.

    Document Manipulation: 
           The document object is specifically focused on the HTML document and provides methods and properties for manipulating and interacting with the document's content.
           It allows you to access and modify elements, styles, attributes, and other aspects of the document     
           Commonly used methods include getElementById(), querySelector(), createElement(), addEventListener(), etc.

    Hierarchy:
             The window object is the top-level object in the browser environment and serves as the parent object of all other objects, including the document object.
        It provides access to the document object and other objects like history, screen, localStorage, etc.
        The document object, in turn, is a child object of the window object and represents the HTML document loaded in the browser.

    Global Access: 
              Both the window object and the document object can be accessed globally in JavaScript. 
           They are accessible from any part of your code within the browser environment.

           In summary, the window object represents the browser window and provides access to global properties and methods, 
           while the document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser and focuses on document manipulation and interaction.
